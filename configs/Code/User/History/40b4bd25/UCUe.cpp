/*
    You are given an integer . Consider the binary representation of this
    number without leading zeroes. You can rotate the binary representation
    of this number by moving its bits to the left end, where the leftmost bit
    moves to the rightmost position.
    Your task is to find the maximum integer you can obtain after performing
    any number of rotations on the binary representation, without adding any
    leading zeroes.
    Input
    The first line contains the number of test cases t.
    Each test case contains one integer n.
    Output
    Output a single integer, the maximum integer you can obtain after
    performing any number of rotations
