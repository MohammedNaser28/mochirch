/*
    Code of Duty is an exciting video game that involves battling rounds
    against big monsters. Your friends Ali and Nego are both avid gamers, and
    Nego has invited Ali to try this game out. In each round, Ali will face a
    monster with a specific number , and he must defeat it using a gun.
    However, Ali can only use a limited number of bullets, so he needs to be
    strategic about how many he takes.
    To succeed in defeating the monster, Nego has given Ali a helpful tip: he
    needs to shoot the monster with a prime number that has the number of
    digits as the monster's number.
    Ali is not a math expert, so he needs your help to figure out the minimum
    number of bullets he needs to defeat each monster and progress to the
    next round. Can you help him out and ensure he emerges victorious in
    each round?
    
    Input
        The first line contains (t). the number of rounds
        The next lines contain a number (n).
    Output
        print t lines each line has the smallest number of bullets Ali needs to
        defeat the monster and go to the next round
