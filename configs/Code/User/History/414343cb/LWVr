        - for each monster:
            Choose an attack type (not the same as the previous monster's).
            Use that attack repeatedly until the monster is defeated (multiple hits may be needed).
            Then move to the next monster, picking a different attack type.
        - dp[i][last]
            n could be 10000 so is not recursive its itrative
            last is the attack used for monster i-1.
                0 (head), 1 (leg), 2 (arm), or 3 (none/initial state).

        check if it`s avilable to create a palindrome string
            if summition of numberes is even
                every 0 and 1 will appear even number of times
            if summition of numberes is odd
                only one of them will be in the middle and it appears odd number of times
        make the smallest lexicographically string, then change the first diff two positions from left
