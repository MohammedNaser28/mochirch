/*
Sometimes, Rady ponders the idea of walking on his arms instead of his
legs, speculating that if he can stand on his arms, he can walk on them
too.

You will be provided with two numbers: l1 representing his current arm
length, and l2 representing the distance from his shoulders to the ground.
Rady can train and extend his arm's length. Your task is to find the
minimum arm length required for Rady to walk on his arms. He can walk
on his arms if the length of his arms is greater than the distance from his
shoulders to the ground.

    Input
    The first line contains the number of test cases t (to 1e3).
    Each test case contains two integers l1 and l2 (to 1e9).
    Output
        Output a single integer, the minimum arm length for Rady to make him
        able to walk on his arms.
