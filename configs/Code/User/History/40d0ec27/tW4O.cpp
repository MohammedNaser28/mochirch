Sometimes, Rady ponders the idea of walking on his arms instead of his
legs, speculating that if he can stand on his arms, he can walk on them
too.
You will be provided with two numbers: representing his current arm
length, and representing the distance from his shoulders to the ground.
Rady can train and extend his arm's length. Your task is to find the

on his arms if the length of his arms is greater than the distance from his
shoulders to the ground.
